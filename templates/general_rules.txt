-   Compile with -Wall -Wextra -Werror and -std=c++98
-   Class names in UpperCamelCase
-   Files will be named according to the class names    -->    ClassName.hpp / ClassName.h,     ClassName.cpp,      ClassName.tpp
-   C++11 and Boost libraries are forbidden
-   *printf(), *alloc() and free() are forbidden-   "using namespace <ns_name>" and "friend" keywords are forbidden
-   No STL until Modules 08 and 09 
-   When using "new" keyword, leakages are possible. Ensure that there are none 
-   From module 02 to 09, classes must be designed in the "Orthodox Canonical Form", except when explicitely stated otherwise
-   No function implementation in the header file 
-   Avoid double inclusion with "include guards" 

- (From cpp02)
From now on, all your classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form,
unless explicitely stated otherwise. Then, they will implement the four required member
functions below:
• Default constructor
• Copy constructor
• Copy assignment operator
• Destructor
